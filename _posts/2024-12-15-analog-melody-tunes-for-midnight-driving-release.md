[Analog Melody - Tunes for Midnight Driving](https://ditto.fm/tunes-for-midnight-driving)

Hey all,

For anyone wondering where I've been, I have been diving deep into some exciting projects, professionally and personally. With December coming, I finally have some time to relax and share more. And I promise I'll be writing more often about all the cool stuff in store :)

This past year at IMG, I've immersed myself in the world of machine learning, becoming obsessed with neural models, researching them, fine-tuning them, and jailbreaking them - as anyone who has talked with me for at least 5 minutes can attest to.

A few years ago, during my last sabbatical at Arm, I poured myself into creating my music album. Twenty intense days, twelve hours composing, writing, mixing, and mastering. The blisters and exhaustion were worth it.

Now I've merged my two passions â€“ music and AI â€“ by developing a neural model that creates, refines, and mixes music based on my music and style. It's the kind of project that would have blown my younger self's mind, and it's just the beginning of what's to come. Now I can play around with hundreds of tracks, and the only thing stopping me are GPU and API credits. Maybe more VRAM as well.

Today, I'm proud to present 'Tunes for Midnight Driving' â€“ my first AI-generated synthwave album. Having grown up on a steady diet of 8-bit and demoscene music, this genre felt like the perfect starting point. The songs, cover art, and Spotify canvases are all products of AI, but they've been shaped by my own (musical) creations.

So if you're driving somewhere (or back home), give it a listen and see how far we've come. Hope you enjoy

P.S. What's next? My dog Wookie (below) needs her own single, and I've already got a rapper lined up to help ðŸ˜†
