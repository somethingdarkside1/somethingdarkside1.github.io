# Fragments of Forever

In spaces where light bends to dream
I found you in the in-between
Like stardust caught in time's own stream
A love too rare for worlds to glean

They shaped for us a flawless dawn
Where pain and shadows lay withdrawn
But we were born of storm and flame
Wild souls no chains could ever tame

Remember twilight by the sea
Your voice across infinity
The love we chose to share and weave
Outshone the flaws we might conceive

I cast these fragments through the night,
Each spark ignites a vivid glow;
Our souls, like stars, ascend in flight,
Beyond the bounds we claim to know

And we will scatter through the night
Our pieces burning twice as bright
Until our souls, like us, will dance
Beyond the bounds of time and chance

Through whispered songs and silver tears
Through all our dreams and hopes and fears
I'll seek you where the starlight bends,
Where love breaks free and life transcends

Though darkness rises deep to hide
The paths where our souls intertwine
Know that my heart, like light through rain,
Will find its way to yours again.

Vitali Liouti
