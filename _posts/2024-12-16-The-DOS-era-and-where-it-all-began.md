# The DOS Era (Taylor’s Version) 

I was around 6 when my dad gifted me my first PC, the [Schneider Euro AT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider_Euro_PC). He paid 50,000 drachmas, around ~$400 in today’s money, for the PC and a CRT monitor. My mum didn’t talk to him for 3 months after finding out – it was more money than they both made. I, on the other hand, could not stop using the damn thing. 

# The 4.77MHz Awakening 

The Schneider Euro PC represented the vanguard of accessible home computing. As one of the first IBM-compatible machines with integrated design and MS-DOS support, it ran on an [Intel 8088 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) at 4.77MHz – the same processor that powered the original IBM PC. To put this in perspective, that's about 100,000 times slower than today's average smartphone. Data lived on 5.25" floppy disks, each holding a mere 360KB, less storage than a single smartphone photo today. 

(More on floppy disks on my next article about my “Demoscene Era”, à la Taylor Swift)

The AT version marked a quantum leap forward from the original model. Instead of the original's basic CGA with its quirky 4-color palette, the Euro PC AT boasted EGA graphics capable of displaying 16 colors from a palette of 64. In an era where most computers could only display four colors at once, this made games look spectacular – at least through the eyes of a six-year-old.

# Learning to speak BASIC 

As many before me, I cut my gaming teeth on Zork. Never finished it, but it sparked something bigger: the urge to create. Armed with an 'Introduction to BASIC' book my dad gave me, I learned programming before multiplication tables, all to build my dream game. 

My first creation? An unnamed text adventure about a kid named Vitali lost in a maze with a single match. Why one match? Nobody knows. It was way more GOTO spaghetti than clean code, but it represented pure crystallized childhood ambition. 

# Code, Pixels, and Promise 

Then [Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia](https://shot97retro.blogspot.com/2019/06/prince-of-persia-in-depth-written-amiga.html) materialized on my screen, shattering my every preconception. It was my personal Plato's cave moment. If my text adventure was shadow puppetry, Prince of Persia was cinema. Mechner had achieved the impossible in 1989 - he made pixels dance. On an Apple II, he created animation so fluid it felt like bottled lightning. 

My GOTO-laden creation suddenly felt like describing ballet through Morse code. The gap between amateur enthusiasm and true mastery yawned like a canyon. I deleted my game and swore off creation for consumption.

*VGA vs EGA vs CGA vs CGA-Mono*


The '90s hit like a technological tsunami. Windows crashed the DOS party, [Sound Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster) cards gave machines their voice, VGA graphics exploded into 256 colors, and hard drives finally killed the floppy disk shuffle. I dived deep into LucasArts' masterpieces (Monkey Island 2's epic 11-disk saga), lost myself in Chris Jones' noir-soaked Tex Murphy series, and marveled at [Peter Molyneux's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Molyneux) [Bullfrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfrog_Productions) revolution, from [Populous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(series)), to [Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(series)), to [Magic Carpet I & II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_(video_game)).

These games weren't just entertainment – they were technological catalysts. [3DFX's Voodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx) graphics cards, essential for titles like Magic Carpet and Tomb Raider, helped birth modern GPU computing. When 3DFX folded, NVIDIA acquired their innovations. Their rival, ATI Technologies, was eventually acquired by AMD, resulting in the creation of the ‘Radeon’ line of GPUs. Gaming technology always shaped the semiconductor industry's evolution. 

This journey shaped me and my path. Hungry for more technology and needing to fund the appetite, I became a web designer in the pre-framework wild west. It was hard work, often tedious, but it kept me in the game. 

# Full Circle: Pixels to Neural Networks 

These days, I find myself reflecting on how different my life journey might have been with access to tools like ChatGPT and Claude. Recently, while creating the website for my AI music label, I witnessed Claude code an entire website in less than a minute – accomplishing in seconds what would have taken weeks in my early career. In just five prompts, it crafted both functional and aesthetically pleasing code, complete with CSS and JavaScript. The experience felt like watching Prince of Persia for the first time again – that same sense of witnessing something revolutionary. You can visit the site here and download the free template on Github. 

So are the dangers around the use of AI/ML justified? Yes. Societies worldwide are still grappling with comprehending and managing this technology's impact. Yet the fundamental human experience remains unchanged: each new technological wave brings both opportunity and challenge, inspiration and intimidation. This one feels as powerful as the steam engine. 

I recently used my Meta Quest to watch videos while I was floating in virtual space during a flight to California, I couldn't help but smile at how far we've come. From my first Schneider with its 16 colors to creating entire theaters in virtual reality – it's the kind of leap that my six-year-old self, typing GOTO commands in BASIC, couldn't have imagined. Yet that same sense of wonder persists. Whether it's Prince of Persia's fluid animation in 1989 or AI conjuring websites in 2024, technology still feels like magic. 

That same magic that made my father spend a year's savings on a computer drives innovation today. Only now, instead of 16 colors, we're painting with artificial intelligence and virtual reality. And somewhere, a six-year-old is experiencing their own technological awakening, learning about the world or building their own game with help from an AI. 

And maybe that's exactly what we need right now – a little bit of magic, a dash of hope, and the endless possibility of the next technological frontier. Thank you dad.
